Too much toxic culture.
Your reporting group leads or rather those incompetent SMGRs makes it more miserable. They have no idea what they want, no clarity in their minds. They just follow 'yes sir' approach to satisfy the egos of their bosses. Always it feels like war room situation.I have seen people in early 30s having back injury, spondylitis, etc due to extreme long working hours, and even after all these your superiors will not even bother to ask about your well-being, rather they will always poke you for more work!
They will call even on weekends to work. Also, if company is giving you holiday as per govt rule, they will compensate that by making you work on Saturday, as 8-14 Saturdays are working on an avg per year!
Not good for an aspirational individual who wants to succeed in career. If you want a secured job with yes sir attitude, then this is your company. All the best!

We should praise other factors more. And in MSIL, they are making every other thing worse.","No one knows management's internal agenda but culture revolves around it. And culture always shifts from top to bottom. Top management decides what work culture they want to establish to achieve their agenda. 
In my 9+ years of experience, I have seen a good company to become a hostile. You can ask any employee and he will tell you that he wants to leave on priority. 
Things which are going wrong....
Work environment - KRA is being set in start but during whole year no one will ask or monitor those parameter. You are mostly doing things which will never be asked during review. Every few days, there is a new wave comes for some parameter on which complete ecosystem shifts and starts behave like fire fighting happening. Each and every hour you will be answerable. Some time you feel is it really contributing to company's revenue. 
Learning - No one talks about it. The day you join this company, from next day you are answerable for your performance. They want result by next day. Even if it is impossible. You wont have time to learn any new skill. The only thing you will do whole day is following up with dealers.
Innovation - Everyone knows about it how much MSIL is innovative.

Politics - It happens every where. Specially if your company is purely Indian. 
Salary - Initially, MSIL was known as pay master but now company started bench marking with other companies and slowly reducing increment amount....Read More"

Spare Parts Coordinator,Delhi Rajpat Nagar,Full Time,,8 Oct 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Maruti Suzuki cars can offer a great resale value due to their high demand in the market. It is a well-known fact that a Maruti Suzuki car can return anywhere near 40-50% or more of the initial value even after 3-4 years. Although the resale value depends a lot on the condition of the car too.,The primary reason for this is the company's lack of presence in the utility vehicle (UV) segment. Maruti Suzuki's domestic market share of passenger vehicles has fallen from 50.1% in the first quarter of FY20 to 40.5% in the first quarter of FY23

6) ZERO skill development initiatives.

If 10 hours of work everyday was not enough now they are making the employees sit at their desks for the entire day with so many interdepartment movement restrictions. Everybody needs to talk to each other via calls and skype and masks and shields must be on all the time. You know where else can we have a similar arrangement without making out lives miserable? At our homes! If no movement is allowed and we have to sit our desks all day long, why can't we just do it at home? It is surprising that nobody in such a big company has the brains to come up with a better strategy. Work from home should be a basic right of an employee specially in critical times like these, while they are making us work in office, where coming to office has no advantage over WFH except getting to see your manager's face all day long....Read More","The work culture is awful. Office politics is everywhere and the most unbelievable part is that there is nowhere to sit in the entire campus that they are so proud of for some reason. The only place you can sit is your work place. Surprisingly even in the healthcare center there are only 2 benches. If you are unwell and are unable to come they can't force you to come because of the ""HR policies"", but that doesn't stop them from stressing you out about your attendance percentage falling and impacting your yearly bonus. So apparently they give you 44 holidays every year but they won't let you consume them because your attendance impacts the department attendance and they care way too much about that....Read More"

The compensation is one of the best in the industry for each job level. I joined the organization as a Graduate Engineer Trainee (GET), and exited the organization as an Assistant Manager in the Supply Chain vertical. Although each vertical has its own essence, but in my opinion the Supply Chain vertical and Production vertical are where there can be maximum learning for a young engineer. To summarize, I would strongly recommend the company to a youngster who is willing to learn and be associated with a very strong brand in the country....Read More","Due to the importance of Supply chain to the bottom line of the company, the going can get very tough sometimes. When I was there in the company i.e. 2014-16, Saturday was working, but now I have got to know that weekends have been kept off across the firm. But for whom work life balance is a priority, Maruti Suzuki is not the most ideal company."

Also, you don't really have to care about job security as their revenues are stable and performance at an individual level is rarely taken into consideration.","The top management is often blind to problems at the ground level. Amidst the push for higher targets, the japanese management scrambles for control and direction. The middle management is most corrupt (and incapable to a certain extent) and getting things done mostly depends on personal relationships instead of having a shared objective. HR processes such as performance appraisal etcetera are reduced to mere formalities and paperwork. Overall, it does not provide a vibrant and enriching environment to work.
